## Introduction

Most people probably give little thought to how containers work under the covers. Still, I think it‚Äôs important to understand the underlying technologies¬†‚Äì it helps to inform our decision‚Äëmaking processes.

This writeup is divided into two main sections, in the first section I will explain the basic idea behind Linux containers using its kernel features like Namespaces, Cgroups, and chroot.

In the second section, I will walk you through a practical example of all that you learned so far by building a container from scratch.

Aren't you excited like me? let's do it

## History of containerization

Before we start talking about containers, let's see first what is Docker and what does it for you.

later we'll see what it does on behalf of you

![High level Docker Architecture ](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Docker-Architecture-2.png align="center")

### Tracing System Calls Starting From Docker Client

### **What is a container?**

In 4 bullet points:

* Containers share the host kernel

* Containers use the kernel's ability to group processes for resource control

* Containers ensure isolation through namespaces

* Containers feel like lightweight VMs (lower footprint, faster), but are **not Virtual Machines!**

Components of a container **ecosystem** include:

* Runtime

* Image distribution

* Tooling

## Essential Technologies

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Kernel Namespaces**

Allow you to create isolation of:

* Process trees (PID Namespace)

* Mounts (MNT namespace) `wc -l /proc/mounts`

* Network (Net namespace) `ip addr`

* Users / UIDs (User Namespace)

* Hostnames (UTS Namespace) `hostname`

* Inter-Process Communication (IPC Namespace) `ipcs`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Cgroups

Kernel control groups (cgroups) allow you to do accounting on resources used by processes, a little bit of access control on device nodes and other things such as freezing groups of processes.

cgroups consist of one hierarchy (tree) per resource (CPU, memory, ‚Ä¶) . for example:

```bash
cpu                      memory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ batch                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 109
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hadoop           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 88 <
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 88 <         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 25
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 109          ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 26
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ realtime             ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ databases
 ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nginx             ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1008
 ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 25            ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 524
 ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 26          
 ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ postgres 
 ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 524  
 ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ redis    
 ¬†¬†     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1008
```

## chroots

With `chroot` you can set up and [run programs or interactive shells](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chroot.1.html) such as Bash in an encapsulated filesystem that is prevented from interacting with your regular filesystem. Everything within the `chroot` environment is penned in and contained. Nothing in the `chroot` environment can see out past its own, special, root directory without escalating to root privileges. That has earned this type of environment the nickname of a `chroot` jail

In some senses, `chroot` environments are closer to containers such as [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/) than to virtual machines. They‚Äôre lightweight, quick to deploy, and creating and firing one up can be automated

We need to create directories to hold the portions of the operating system our `chroot` environment will require. We‚Äôre going to set up a minimalist Linux environment that uses Bash as the interactive shell.

follow along with me

```sh
docker run -it --name docker-host --rm --privileged ubuntu:bionic
```

Then inside this ubuntu container, we're going to make our `chroot` environment

`ldd` is used to list the command's dependencies

```bash
root@6639a75f6ca3:/# mkdir my-new-root
root@6639a75f6ca3:/# cp bin/bash my-new-root/bin
root@6639a75f6ca3:/# ldd bin/bash
root@6639a75f6ca3:/# mkdir my-new-root/lib{,64}
root@6639a75f6ca3:/# chroot my-new-root bash
```

To see which libs bash depends on

```sh
$ ldd bin/bash

linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd55bfe000)
 libtinfo.so.5 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5 (0x00007fdb3e708000)
 libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fdb3e504000)
 libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fdb3e113000)
 /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fdb3ec4c000)
```

so we need to move those libs to their dedicated folders

```go
1. using package manager
```

```bash
root@6639a75f6ca3:/# cp /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 my-new-root/lib
root@6639a75f6ca3:/# cp /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 my-new-root/lib64/
```

after moving we can now change the root to our new root directory and start a bash session

```bash
root@6639a75f6ca3:/# chroot my-new-root bash
```

üî¥ if you try to use any command you'll notice there are no commands to be executed, that's because all we've got inside this new root is the bash only

you will notice two important things:

* now our root directory is my-new-root and we can't reach outside this environment now

* if we want to add a new command, for example, we've to explicitly do this by moving the command from whatever it resides in our host and moving it's libs to our `chroot` environment

So what's the problem with chroot?

> what's the problem?

## Namespaces

### What are Namespaces? ü§î

> ***Namespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that partitions kernel resources such that one set of processes sees one set of resources while another set of processes sees a different set of resources***

The idea of namespaces is to let each process take its own process IDs, network layer, resources, etc to avoid conflict with other processes.

There are more than one type of namespace, for example:

A [**process ID (PID) namespace**](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html) assigns a set of PIDs to processes that are independent of the set of PIDs in other namespaces. The first process created in a new namespace has PID¬†1 and child processes are assigned subsequent PIDs. If a child process is created with its own PID namespace, it has PID¬†1 in that namespace as well as its PID in the parent process‚Äô namespace.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670159658259/-9brMk2EK.png align="left")

From the image above, we can see that:

* the `PID namespace 1(parent)` can see child namespaces PIDs, but the child can't see outside themselves

* in each namespace, the first process is `PID 1`

To demonstrate this idea in practice, let's get our hands dirty and start a long-running process inside your main container

```bash
root@6639a75f6ca3:/ echo "top secret" >> /my-new-root/secret.txt
root@6639a75f6ca3:/ tail -f my-new-root/secret.txt
```

after that connect to the same main container from another shell

```bash
docker exec -it docker-host bash
```

From the `Docker host 2` you've just connected to, we're going to list all the processes

```bash
# Docker-host 2
root@6639a75f6ca3:/# ps aux
USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root           1  0.0  0.0  18520  3348 pts/0    Ss   21:21   0:00 bash
root          46  0.0  0.0   4580   832 pts/0    S+   21:38   0:00 tail -f secret.txt
root          47  0.1  0.0  18520  3376 pts/1    Ss   21:41   0:00 bash
root          58  0.0  0.0  34416  2904 pts/1    R+   21:42   0:00 ps aux
```

üîµüòÉ notice that we see the `tail -f` and `bash [47]` from our chroot environment.

let's kill that process

```bash
// Docker-host 2
kill 46 # pkill <processName>
```

you'll notice that the process got terminated from `Docker host 1`

```sh
// Docker-host 1
root@6639a75f6ca3:/# tail -f secret.txt
secret
Terminated
```

so with namespaces, we can solve this problem by isolating each process from seeing what other processes are doing! we'll use a command called `unshare`

### üß™ A practical example

1. we'll create a child process (jailed process)

2. then we'll unshare \[processes, file systems, network layer\] from that child process

3. from docker host 2 we'll see how each host can control the child process but the child cannot

**üü¢ using** `debootstrap` **which is used to bootstrap a new environment and you can chroot the directory into it.**

```sh
// Docker host 1
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install debootstrap -y
// creating a new bare minimal set of a file system we need to run a debian based ubuntu
$ debootstrap --variant=minbase bionic /better-root
```

then we can unshare this newly created environment

```sh
// Docker host 1
$ unshare --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid --fork --user --map-root-user chroot /better-root bash
root@6639a75f6ca3:/# ps aux
Error, do this: mount -t proc proc /proc
# we need to mount a process first
$ mount -t proc none /proc mount -t sysfs none /sys mount -t tmpfs none /tmp
```

> **From the host we can see inside the child, from a child we can't see outside of itself**

```bash
# Docker-host 1
$ echo "sample" >> sample.txt
$ tail -f sample.txt

# Docker-host 2
root@6639a75f6ca3:/# ps aux
USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root           1  0.0  0.0  18520  3356 pts/0    Ss   21:21   0:00 bash
root          47  0.0  0.0  18520  3396 pts/1    Ss   21:41   0:00 bash
root        7406  0.0  0.0   4532   772 pts/0    S    21:53   0:00 unshare --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid --fork --user --map-root-user chroot /better-root bash
root        7407  0.0  0.0  18512  3424 pts/0    S    21:53   0:00 bash
root        7427  0.0  0.0   4572   768 pts/0    S+   22:05   0:00 tail -f sample.txt
root        7428  0.0  0.0  34416  2928 pts/1    R+   22:05   0:00 ps aux

$ kill 7427

# Docker-host 1
root@6639a75f6ca3:/# tail -f sample.txt
welcome
Terminated
```

üü¢ **the host can control everything that's happening inside the child process, but the child process can't see outside itself**

## Control groups (Cgroups)

A control group (cgroup) is a Linux kernel feature that limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, and so on) of a collection of processes.

Cgroups provide the following features:

* **Resource limits**¬†‚Äì You can configure a cgroup to limit how much of a particular resource (memory or CPU, for example) a process can use.

* **Prioritization**¬†‚Äì You can control how much of a resource (CPU, disk, or network) a process can use compared to processes in another cgroup when there is resource contention.

* **Accounting**¬†‚Äì Resource limits are monitored and reported at the cgroup level.

* **Control**¬†‚Äì You can change the status (frozen, stopped, or restarted) of all processes in a cgroup with a single command.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670160480614/wr1G6-1Sz.png align="left")

### Creating a Cgroup

The following command creates a¬†v1 cgroup (you can tell by pathname format) called `foo` and sets the memory limit for it to¬†50,000,000 bytes (50 MB).

by creating a directory and

```bash
root # mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo
root # echo 50000000 > /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo/memory.limit_in_bytes
```

```bash
Making a long running process u
root # ./test.sh & 
[1] 2428
root # cgroup  tool

root # echo 2428 > /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo/cgroup.procs
```

```bash
root # ps -o cgroup 2428
CGROUP
12:pids:/user.slice/user-0.slice/\
session-13.scope,10:devices:/user.slice,6:memory:/foo,...
```
